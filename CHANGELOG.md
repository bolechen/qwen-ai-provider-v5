## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- **Tool Call Compatibility**:
  - Fixed `QwenChatLanguageModel` to emit `tool-call` stream parts with string `input` payloads, matching the AI SDK v5 `LanguageModelV2ToolCall` contract
  - Ensured non-streaming `doGenerate` also returns `tool-call` content with stringified JSON `input`
  - This resolves `toolCall.input.trim is not a function` errors when using `qwen-ai-provider-v5` together with ai-sdk v5 tool execution

- **Testing**:
  - Updated chat model tests to assert string `input` for tool calls in both streaming and non-streaming modes

  - Updated author information

- **Documentation**: Enhanced README with AI SDK v5 focus
  - Added prominent notice about AI SDK v5 requirement
  - Linked to original `qwen-ai-provider` package for v4 users
